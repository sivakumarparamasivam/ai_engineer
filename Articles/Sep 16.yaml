Unlock Multi-Agent Collaboration with Agno

What is Agno?
Agno is an open-source framework for building AI agents that can think, remember, use tools, and work together. It’s model-agnostic (works with many LLMs), lightweight, and fast.

Core Architecture
Agent – main unit, powered by an LLM + instructions + tools.
Tools – external APIs (search, finance, etc.) agents can call.
Memory & Storage – remembers past interactions or sessions.
Knowledge (RAG) – fetches info from documents or databases.
Structured Output – returns data in JSON/tables, not just text.
Multi-Agent / Workflows – several agents can collaborate on tasks.
Monitoring – dashboards, logs, and performance tracking.

Levels of Systems (simple to complex)
Basic agent with tools.
Add knowledge (documents).
Add memory (context, reasoning).
Teams of agents.
Full workflows with state and determinism.

Key Features
Works with different AI models (not locked in).
Handles text, images, audio, video (multi-modal).
Remembers user history (personalization).
Can reference stored course materials (RAG).
Outputs structured results (e.g., quizzes).
Agents can collaborate in workflows.
Monitoring for debugging and scaling.


Testing Considerations
Tool or model failures.
Memory accuracy and data privacy.
Consistency (esp. grading/assessments).
Performance with many users.
Output format validation.
Edge cases (bad inputs, multimodal failures).
